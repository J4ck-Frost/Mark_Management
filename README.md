This project is a microservices-based Spring Boot application for managing exams and student scores. It includes three services: ExamAdministrationService for creating and managing exam details and status, CandidateManagementService for handling candidate registration and exam participation, and MarkManagementService for recording and finalizing exam scores. The system uses Spring Boot, Spring Web, MongoDB, WebClient for inter-service communication, and optionally Kafka for asynchronous event handling. Each service is independently deployable and communicates over REST or messaging.
